    <h2> ingredents</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>¾ cup plain yogurt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon chopped fresh mint leaves</li>
       <li> 2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>  1 pound ground beef </li>
            <li> 1 ½ cups chopped onion </li>
                <li>1 cup water</li>
                    <li> 1 carrot, grated</li>



    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
    <li>In a small bowl, stir together yogurt, mint, and garlic. Refrigerate.</li>
<li>In a large skillet over medium heat, cook ground beef and onions until meat is browned, stirring occasionally to crumble; drain fat. Stir in 1 cup water, carrot, salt, black pepper, 1 1/2 teaspoons coriander, and 1/2 teaspoon cumin; simmer uncovered for 30 minutes or until water evaporates.</li>
<li>Lay out wonton wrappers on aluminum foil. Mound two large spoonfuls of beef mixture in the center of one wrapper. Dip a finger in water and trace it around all four edges. Lay a second wonton wrapper on top of the first, and press on all edges to seal. Roll up the edges to create a round, hat-shaped ravioli. Repeat, making 13 ravioli.</li>
<li>Place ravioli in steamer and steam 40 minutes.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, mix together the yellow split peas, 1/8 teaspoon red pepper flakes, 1 teaspoon coriander, 1/4 teaspoon cumin, chicken bouillon, and 1 1/2 cups of water in a saucepan. Bring to a boil, then simmer over medium-low heat for about 45 minutes, or until it reaches a thick slurry-like consistency.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, in the large skillet, mix remaining beef mixture with 2 tablespoons water, tomato paste, and 1/8 teaspoon red pepper flakes. Simmer over low heat until liquid has evaporated, about 10 minutes.</li>
<li>To serve, spread yogurt on a serving plate. Top with ravioli, and top again with split pea mixture. Finally, top with tomato and beef mixture. Serve immediately.</li>
